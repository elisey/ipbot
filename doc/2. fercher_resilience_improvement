Reworking main fetching logic

Use all fetchers which are enabled in config
fetch in parallel (async)

compare the results. here we have 2 options
option1:
all results are the same
then
print ip address (through template) to the user

option 2:
some fetchers failed or some ip addresses are not the same
then
print result breakdown. For each fetcher print its ip address of error if it failed (network or parsing or any other error)

move template from config to template files
We will have 2 template files: for option 1 and option 2


Change of fetching logic. Check if all fetchers are the same - only for not failed fetchers. If fetcher failed - skip it and reflect
We are going away from wwo options for view - optimistic and breakdown.

# All works. List all fetchers with green emoji near each and write ip addres at the top

🌐 IP address: 10.10.10.1

🟢 identme
🟢 ifconfig
🟢 ipify
🟢 ipinfo

# Some timeouts. Mark failed fetcher with red cross and add error name

🌐 IP address: 10.10.10.1

🟢 identme
❌ ifconfig: Timeout
🟢 ipify
🟢 ipinfo

# Different results. If ip addresses for not failed fetchers are not the same - mark them with yellow cicle emoji. Ip address at the top is unknown.

🌐 IP address: unknown

🟡 identme: 10.10.10.1
❌ ifconfig: Parsing error
🟡 ipify: Network error
🟡 ipinfo: 180.3.3.5

Configuration Updates
Do not extend the configuration. We already have there fetchers list. this is enough

Suggest different ways other than templates if nessesary. Logic can be incaplusated in separate class
